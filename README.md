# TOP Ruby on Rails Auth Project (Members Only)

[link](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-on-rails/lessons/authentication?ref=lnav#project-2-members-only)

Project builds a Rails app where registered users can post (and comment) on the app about non members.  Members can see who wrote a post, but those on the outside (not logged in) and not see who wrote it.
